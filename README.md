# FASTQ File Handling with Biopython

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to work with **FASTQ files** using the Biopython library. 
The notebook introduces fundamental bioinformatics operations such as reading, parsing, and analyzing sequence data from high-throughput sequencing experiments.

## ðŸ“˜ Contents
- Introduction to FASTQ format
- Reading FASTQ files with Biopython
- Extracting sequences and quality scores
- Simple sequence analysis and utilities
- Writing sequence data back to files

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fastq_biopython.git
cd fastq_biopython
```

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv bioenv
source bioenv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
bioenv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Notebook
Start Jupyter Notebook and open the `.ipynb` file:
```bash
jupyter notebook Fastaq_files.ipynb
```
